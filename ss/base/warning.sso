Note 1 Suggestion: This model has just one settlement event. Changing to recr_dist_method 4 and removing the recruitment distribution parameters at the end of the MG parms section (below growth parameters) will produce identical results and simplify the model.
Warning 1 : Minimum pop size bin:_10; is > L at Amin for sex: 1; Gpat: 1; L= 5
Warning 2 : Early recdev biasadj is >2 times ratio of rmse to sigmaR
Warning 3 : Final gradient: 9.56052e-05 is larger than final_conv: 1e-05
Note 2 Information: A revised protocol for the Fcast_yr specification is available and recommended.
