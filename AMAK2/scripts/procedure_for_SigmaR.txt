Based on Grant's work steps are to:
1) run model with sigmaR freely estimated
2) run with sigmaR fixed at value from 1)
3) using "output" sigmaR from 2), 
To calculate ?ymarg, do the following:
Set ?yest provisionally at a very high value, so that the resulting estimate of ytru is theoretically equal to yobs
Given yobs, calculate ?yfull by iteration (requires ?>0.75)
Given yobs and ?yfull, ?? 2 can be calculated as
sig=sigfull(var(

Finally, calculate ?ymarg from yobs and ??
