# GOA pop models for playing w/
## Todo list
    [x] Add in survey biomass     
    [x] Update inputs     
    [x] Time varying selectivity
    [ ] Incorporate length composition data...
    [ ] Figure out which models to use going forward     
    [ ] Explore:
    16.0    Same as 2016 model w/ all new data
    16.0a   Francis method for tuning time varying selectivity variance term, 
    16.0b   Francis method for tuning time varying selectivity variance term, survey sample size tuned (ends up being 26 average)
    16.0c   Blocks instead of time varying, tuned using Francis weights

    _WE PICKED MODEL 16.0b_


## Model sequence (model_0, model_1, etc
		0 Fixed selectivity  
		1 Crazy time varying fishery selectivity
