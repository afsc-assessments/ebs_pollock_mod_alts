#Questions on Atka mackerel 2013 version...
1.  Are the ages given final?
2.  I'll work on table in front (Grant had some specific changes there)
3.  Does the following set of models make sense:
    * `Mod0.ctl`: Last years configuration without new data (except for updated catches)
    * `Mod1.ctl`: Last years configuration with new data
    * `Mod2.ctl`: Alternative selectivity constraint (based on CAPAM work)
    * `Mod3.ctl`: As above but with alternative sigmaR estimate (as in Grant's method)
    * `Mod4.ctl`: As above but with ...based on models 0-3...    * 
4.  Table 17.6 is unchanged correct?

##Immediate tasks
1.  Get catches for 2012 and 2013 (from Akfin, presently just used 50k for 2013...will do this today hopefully)
2.  Add in data Sandra provided (done but see figure below)
3.  

#Responses
Answers to ?s:   

1. Yes, ages are final. Survey ages were presented last year but not available in time for the model. 2012 fishery ages are final and were extracted from Norpac.  
2. Great, thx. Is that in reference to adding U and L 95% CI for fem. SB?  
3. Thoughts on models:  
 
  Mod0--We did not present Mod0 config in last yr's assessment, but I guess it is standard to do this run to make sure we are starting in the same place(?)
 
  Mod1--yes. New data would be updated and new catch and 2012 survey and fishery age data.
 
  Mod2--yes/maybe, but depends on if this is all ready to go from CAPAM and won't interfere with EBS pollocks. I'm excited about this but needs to be your call.
 
  Mod3--no(?). Only bc the PTs didn't go foward with a recommendation and suggested further analysis. Text from minutes based on working group report:  

####"B4: Alternatives for setting/estimating ÏƒR
The Teams recommend further analysis, including consideration of a full Bayesian integration as an additional alternative."   
 
4) yes, Table 17.6 is unchanged.
 
Other tasks

1. 2012 and 2013 catch-to-date from CAS attached. Updated 2012 catch is 50,765 t. 2013 catch is 21,299 t of a TAC of 25,920 t. The 2013 ABC is 50K. I think we should assume full TAC of 25,920 for 2013 catch. Other option would be to assume 95% of TAC as was taken in 2012, but I think they will try very hard to take the 2013 TAC since it is so reduced.  
 
2. Blue bars--yes!
 
3. Don't cross the picket lines if grocery workers strike! Support the workers!
