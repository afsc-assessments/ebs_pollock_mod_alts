    [ ] Explore:
    16.0    Same as 2016 model w/ all new data
    16.0a   Francis method for tuning time varying selectivity variance term, 
    16.0b   Francis method for tuning time varying selectivity variance term, survey sample size tuned (ends up being 26 average)
    16.0c   Blocks instead of time varying, tuned using Francis weights

    _WE PICKED MODEL 16.0b_
