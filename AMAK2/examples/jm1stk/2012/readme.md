ADMB code and datafiles for the Chilean jack mackerel assessment
=================================

Updated from 2012 (with changes tracked here) to allow    
  1. age-specific natural mortality (option)  
  2. length composition data for indices  
  3. other refinements  


Note that datafiles from last year need to be modified slightly to this format to run 

# Places where datafiles are changed

1. length bins specified (uses number of bins, bin values)
2. indices now accept length frequency data
